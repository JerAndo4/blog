1. In the fifth week I did all the labs that are available at the moment.

2. I have a little understanding of Object-Oriented Programming

3. I ate delicious food all week.

4. I don't know what to write anymore, so I'll insert Trudy Garfunkel's quote about the Bolshoi Theatre:

***"The Bolshoi Ballet is a universe of fantasy, the focus of magic, beauty and romance. This is the world of graceful ballerinas, majestic music and luxurious costumes"***
