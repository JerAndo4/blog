## Overview

1. In the fourth week, I did all the labs that are available at the moment.

2. I've been eating deliciously all week. 

3. I don't know what to write anymore, therefore, I will insert a quote by Alberto Mangel about the Great Library:

***"We can wander along the charred shelves of the Library of Alexandria, where all imagination and all wisdom are collected; and see in its death a warning that everything we have collected will be lost"***
