1. In the second week, I did all the labs that are available at the moment.

2. I've been eating deliciously all week. 

3. Remembered the basics of the C++ programming language

4. I don't know what to write anymore, so a clipping from one of my favorite video games on russian:

*"–ì–æ–≤–æ—Ä—è—Ç, –º–æ—ë –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –±–æ–≥–æ–≤. –ù–µ–ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞. –Ø –≤–æ–∑–≤—ã—à–∞—é—Å—å –Ω–∞–¥ –Ω–∏–º–∏."*
